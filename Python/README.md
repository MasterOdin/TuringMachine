Python Turing Machine Simulator
===
A command line turing machine that can read in a json file that describes a TM, then can run that on a tape.

Example simulator written in [turing_machine.py](https://github.com/MasterOdin/TuringMachine/blob/master/Python/turing_machine.py) that reads in two different TM machines and tests valid tapes on them.

To-Do:
---
* Allow more input types (simple text file (like processing), xml, etc)  
* Add graphical elements to the simulator (create state graph that shows where TM is in a spatial way)
