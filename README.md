Turing Machine Emulators
==========================

This repository will hold [Turing Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) emulators in a variety of languages. Implementations will probably be different between the languages (in both features and the underlying data structures). Once I'm happy with a TM implementaiton, I'll move it to done, though this may mean it's less feature packed than some other language implementaiton.

Done
----
[Processing](https://github.com/MasterOdin/tree/master/Processing) - Shows the tape state (and some other details) in a graphical pop-up during execution


In Progress
-----------
[Python](https://github.com/MasterOdin/tree/master/Python) - Runs through a TM in a cli. Reads in the TM details from a JSON file.  

Planned
-------
Java  
Scheme  
Lisp
